Basic Recovery Example for ParallelLLMProcessor

This simple example demonstrates the core recovery functionality:
1. Create a database with some incomplete results (simulating interruption)
2. Use recover_from_database to complete the processing
3. Verify that recovery worked correctly

This is the simplest possible recovery example - perfect for getting started.
